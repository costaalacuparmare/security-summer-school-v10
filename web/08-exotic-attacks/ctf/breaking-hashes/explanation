You notice that you have to find an username and a password that are not equal
(in the context of PHP loose comparison) but their sha256 hashes are the same, meaning
same number, different data types.

We can pass the parameters as arrays and make one of the values a string,
and the other the integer equivalent.

A possible payload in POST data is:

`username[]="2"&password[]=2&submit=Login`
